# Lesson 2: Creating a Scrapy Project

After setting up the Python virtual environment, activating it, and installing Scrapy (refer to the basic setup guide if needed), we can now create our first Scrapy project.

## Step 1: Start a New Scrapy Project
To create a new Scrapy project, run the following command:
```sh
scrapy startproject bookscraper
```
This will generate a folder structure for your Scrapy project.

## Step 2: Navigate Into the Project Directory
Change into the newly created project directory:
```sh
cd bookscraper
```

Your Scrapy project is now set up and ready for further development!
